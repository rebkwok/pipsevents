    <h2>PayPal Email Check</h2>
    <p>Use this to check payments to an alternative paypal email.  Enter the email address
    you want to check below and click 'Submit'.</p>

        <p>A paypal button will appear.  When you click the paypal
    button it will take you to a PayPal payment page to make a payment of Â£0.01 to the
    requested email.</p>

    <p>Make the payment using any valid PayPal payment method.  You'll
        receive an email from the booking system confirming if the payment was processed successfully.</p>

    <p>
    Note that you'll receive an email from PayPal directly as well; <strong>you need to ALSO receive the email from the
        booking system</strong> to confirm that the system has been able to process the payment to the requested
        email address properly.
