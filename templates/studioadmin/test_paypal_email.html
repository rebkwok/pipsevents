    <h2>Check paypal email</h2>
    <p>Use this to check payments to an alternative paypal email.  Enter the email address
    you want to check below and click 'Submit'.  A paypal button will appear.  When you click the paypal
    button it will take you to a paypal payment page to make a payment of Â£0.01 to the
    requested email.  Make the payment using any valid payment method.  Depending on how quickly the
        paypal notification is returned, you may receive confirmation details by the time you return to
    the site.  If paypal is being slow and the notification hasn't been received yet, you'll just see a
    message that payment is being processed.  Either way, you'll receive an email with the results of the payment.
    Note that you'll receive an email from paypal directly as well; you need to ALSO receive the email from the
        booking site to confirm that the system has been able to process the payment to the requested
        email address properly.
