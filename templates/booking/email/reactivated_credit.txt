<h4>CREDIT BLOCK REACTIVATION</h4>

<p>Thank you for your patience and support during studio closures and lockdowns.</p>
    {% if reactivation_date %}
        {% if report_type == "reactivation" %}
            <p>Credit blocks have now been reactivated with a start date of {{ reactivation_date|date:'d M Y' }}</p>
        {% else %}
            <p>Credit blocks will be reactivated on <strong>{{ reactivation_date|date:'d M Y' }}</strong>.
                You will receive another email when this happens.</p>
        {% endif %}
    {% else %}
        <p>Credit blocks will be reactivated in September.  You will receive another email when this happens.</p>
    {% endif %}

<p>After classes were cancelled for the first lockdown on 17th March 2020, we took an inventory of blocks and
    transfer credits that were assigned for cancelled classes.  Any blocks/credits that were active on 17th March 2020
    will be reactivated with the same length of time to expiry.  E.g. if you had a block that expired on 24th March 2020,
    it will be reactivated with one week left to use.
</p>

<p>Please see below for a breakdown of your block status.  If you have waived credits, or used them for online classes,
individual training, raffles etc, these will be listed below.</p>
