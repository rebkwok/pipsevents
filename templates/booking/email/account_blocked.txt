Dear {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }},

Your account has been locked due to multiple no-shows or late cancellations. You will not be able to make any new bookings until {{ user.ban.end_date|date:"d M Y, H:i" }}.

We apologise for the incovenience, however classes are currently very busy, with long waiting lists and no-shows/late cancellations prevent other students from being able to book into classes.
