    Holds info about user memberships

    Created in the stripe webhook when a customer.subscription.create event is received

    Subscription ID, Membership and User should never change after initial creation
    (MembershipPrice could change on a Membership)
    A change of membership plan sets the end date on the current one and creates a new
    UserMembership with the start of the next one.

    Start date and end date refer to the MEMBERSHIP (not to the stripe subscription) and
    are used to determine whether a UserMembership with an active stripe subscription is
    valid for use for a class on a particular date.  (Membership is used to verify that
    it is valid for the class event_type.) They will always be the 1st of a month.

    A user can have at most 1 active UserMemberships for any one period
    start date now or 1st of next month; pricing charges on 25th
    A user can have more than one UserMembership, but only one that is current at any one time
    There should only be one UserMembershp
                    
    subscription_id should be unique on UserMembership. If plan (membership) changes (on user request), the current
    subscription is cancelled and a new subscription is created. Changes to the price of a membership will
    result in a subscription update webhook event, but don't change anything on the UserMembership.

    status refers to current status on Stripe of subscription
    To verify if this membership is valid, check start/end dates as well as subscription status

    eg. 1) User buys membership A on 12th April; to start this month
    Create UserMembership with start date 1st April
    end date = None
    status = incomplete; once paid, updates to active
     
    e.g. 2) User buys membership A on 12th April; to start next month
    Create UserMembership with start date 1st May
    end date = None
    status = incomplete; once setup intent succeeds, updates to active

    e.g. 3) User upgrades to Membership B
    Cancel this subscription from end of current period, set end date to 1st of next month (checks on class date will check it is < end date (exclusive))
    Create new UserMembership and a new stripe subscription (using the payment method from the previous one), for Membership B, start 1st next month
    Move all bookings for next month from previous UserMembership to new one. 
    Check for unpaid bookings for next month and apply new UserMembership
    
    e.g. 4) User downgrades to Membership C
    Cancel this subscription from end of current period, set end date to 1st of next month (checks on class date will check it is < end date (exclusive))
    Create new UserMembership and a new stripe subscription (using the payment method from the previous one), for Membership C, start 1st next month
    Move all bookings for next both from previous UserMembership to new one where possible. Mark any that
    can't be applied (due to reduced usage) to unpaid (ordered by event date).
    
    e.g. 5) User cancels membership
    Cancel subscription from end of period. 
    Set end date of this UserMembership to to 1st of next month
    (webhook will set status when it actually changes)
